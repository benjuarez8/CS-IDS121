CS 121 Final 

Example:

foo(_a_, b, c)
 * b is also a candidate key
 * c is a foreign key to bar.c

Where _a_ indicates that a is a primary key

-- [Problem 1.2]


servers(_hostname_, server_type)
 * note that servers allows for the enforcement of unique hostnames 

accounts(_username_, website_url, acct_type)
 * note that accounts allows for enforcement of unique usernames
 * website_url is a candidate key (as denoted by italics in E-R diagram)

software_pkgs(_pkg_name_, _version_, description, monthly_price)

dedicated_servers(_hostname_, operating_system, site_capacity, server_type)
 * note that dedicated_servers now includes all of the attributes from the 
   servers superclass (from E-R) which was a design choice made in order to
   allow greater usage/efficiency with dedicated servers
 * hostname is a foreign key to servers.hostname

shared_servers(_hostname_, operating_system, site_capacity, server_type)
 * note that dedicated_servers now includes all of the attributes from the 
   servers superclass (from E-R) which was a design choice made in order to
   allow for greater usage/efficiency with dedicated servers directly
 * hostname is a foreign key to servers.hostname

preferred_accts(_username_, email, website_url, created_acct, sub_price, 
acct_type, hostname)
 * note that preferred_accts now includes all of the attributes from the 
   accounts superclass (from E-R) which was a design choice made in order
   to allow for greater usage/efficiency with preferred accounts directly
 * private_hostings was efficiently combined into this schema since its 
   primary key would be username (or hostname) as we know that each
   preferred account is associated with exactly one hostname (& vice versa)
 * hostname is also a candidate key
 * website_url is also a candidate key
 * hostname is a foreign key to dedicated_servers.hostname
 * username is a foreign key to accounts.username

basic_accts(_username_, email, website_url, created_acct, sub_price, 
acct_type, hostname)
 * note that basic_accts now includes all of the attributes from the 
   accounts superclass (from E-R) which was a design choice made in order
   to allow for greater usage/efficiency with basic accounts directly
 * public_hostings was efficiently combined into this schema since its
   primary key would be username anyways, as we know that each basic 
   account is associated with exactly one hostname
 * website_url is also a candidate key
 * hostname is a foreign key to shared_servers.hostname
 * username is a foreign key to accounts.username

pkg_installations(_hostname_, _pkg_name_, _version_)
 * hostname is a foreign key to servers.hostname
 * (pkg_name, version) is a foreign key to 
   (software_pkgs.pkg_name, software_pkgs.version)

customer_pkgs(_username_, _pkg_name_, _version_)
 * username is a foreign key to accounts.username
 * (pkg_name, version) is a foreign key to 
   (software_pkgs.pkg_name, software_pkgs.version)
